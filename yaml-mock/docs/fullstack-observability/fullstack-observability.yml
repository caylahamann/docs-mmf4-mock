# HOW THIS WORKS:
# this is the full stack observability category which is one of the most complex categories
# the intention is to show the simplicity of using YAML to manage navigation.
# the APM category has been mocked out with a directory structure to show the directory relation to the navigation.

Full Stack Observability:
  - Observe everything:
      - Observability solutions:
